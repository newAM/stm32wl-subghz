# STM32WL-SUBGHZ

Embedded rust driver for the STM32WL sub-GHz radio.

This is a **work in progress**, it is unstable, incomplete, and untested.

**Use at your own risk.**

There should be enough code for very basic LoRa or GFSK TX.

## Why upload incomplete code?

This has uploaded to github in an incomplete state because this is better than
nothing for other people developing on these new chips.

I am also hoping to find other people using these chips with rust who want to
collaborate on creating a HAL :)
